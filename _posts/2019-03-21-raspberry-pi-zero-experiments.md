This video demonstrations is a quick preview of using a Raspberry Pi Zero, e-Ink display and a LED to create a personal ToDo dashboard. At the moment, this setup allows me to create tasks on Wunderlist, that then is displayed on the e-Ink display. A Red LED indicates that there are pending tasks that need to be completed. 
Shortly, I will share the source code and instructions to build this by yourself. It took me couple of hours of coding, and an hour of assembling to put this together.
