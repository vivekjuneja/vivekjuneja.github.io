<p><strong>What was great on web</strong>
<em>Writing Well</em>
One of the most significant aspects of my job as a leader is to communicate. It permeates every aspect of my role. I love the written word and being good at writing is a constant pursuit for me. Someone recommended me the book ‚ÄúOn Writing well‚Äù by William Zinsser, and it was an amazing book. More recently, I happened to find this online guide, and was delightfully surprised by it. For those who want to improve their writing, this guide is helpful and will get you hooked.
