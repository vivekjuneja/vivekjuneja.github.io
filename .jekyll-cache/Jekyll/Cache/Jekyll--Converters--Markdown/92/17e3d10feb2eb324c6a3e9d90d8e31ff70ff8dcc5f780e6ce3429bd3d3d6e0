  I learned to code when I was 12, starting with LOGO and BASIC. I moved to Visual Basic and QWBasic in late school. I remember the 90s with the dial-up internet as the next big thing. I started the internet journey using Netscape Navigator and Lynx for web browsing. I then moved on to C and C++.

  I did my undergrad in Computer Science and engineering, and had my first stint with Python, and Natural Language Processing. 

  I have been a professional software developer for over 10 years, with my career pursuits taking me around the world.

  I used to work in Seoul, a city on the cusp of revolution leading the way how modern societies will embrace and influence technology. 
  
  I am now in Berlin, helping engineering teams become better everyday. On the side, I tinker with low-power devices that host containerized workloads running Machine Learning algorithms.

  I love spreading my knowledge, through blogs, articles and the occassional opportunities of talking in public. 

  My interests lie in Software Development, Technology Evangelism, Artificial Intelligence, Human Psychology, Behaviorial Economics and Lean Startups.
