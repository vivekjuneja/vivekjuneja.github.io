Hard problems with K8s

Even with kubeadm and a team of 6 you canâ€™t get upstream K8s production ready in 6 months. We tried. 

Hard Problems:
- High Availability
- Single Sign On
- Multitennancy
- Resource Isolation
- Permission Management
- Upgrades
- Backups
- Package Management
- CI/CD Integration
