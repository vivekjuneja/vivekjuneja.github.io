I"™<p>AWS reInvent has been huge this year with interest announcements and great talks. The sheer volume of content shared is too hard for a person to digest and infer. Hence, I took the time to create a custom playlist for talks that seemed great to me, especially with the content they shared with the audience.</p>

<p>I am hopeful that I could summarize these talks to make it easy for one to remember and analyze. That post is coming soon.</p>

<p>Till then Enjoy !!!</p>
