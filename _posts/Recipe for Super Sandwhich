2. Stir fry, in Olive oil, the cut slices of Yellow Pepper and Garlic cloves, till they turn little brown. Take it off and keep it aside.

3. Toast the 2 bread slices, and put some butter on the face facing up, and let it melt. On one of the bread slices, use the Cream cheese as a spread, and apply it evenly. On the other slide, put the Avocado spread in the center of the bread. On this same slice, put the fried Yellow pepper slices and garlic cloves. Keep the other bread slice on this, and press it hard to have the spread evenly distribute across the surface. 

4. Your toast is ready. Serve it with fries or chips.
