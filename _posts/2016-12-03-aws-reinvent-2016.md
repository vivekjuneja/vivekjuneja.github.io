title: My picks from AWS Reinvent 2016 to learn and digest
category: learning
---

AWS reInvent has been huge this year with interest announcements and great talks. The sheer volume of content shared is too hard for a person to digest and infer. Hence, I took the time to create a custom playlist for talks that seemed great to me, especially with the content they shared with the audience.

I am hopeful that I could summarize these talks to make it easy for one to remember and analyze. That post is coming soon.

Till then Enjoy !!!
