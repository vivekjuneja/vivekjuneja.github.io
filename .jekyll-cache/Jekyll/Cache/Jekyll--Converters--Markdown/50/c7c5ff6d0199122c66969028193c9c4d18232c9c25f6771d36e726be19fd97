<p><strong>What was great on web</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro"><em>Writing Well</em>&lt;/&gt;</a></p>

<p>One of the most significant aspects of my job as a leader is to communicate. It permeates every aspect of my role. I love the written word and being good at writing is a constant pursuit for me. Someone recommended me the book ‚ÄúOn Writing well‚Äù by William Zinsser, and it was an amazing book. More recently, I happened to find this online guide, and was delightfully surprised by it. For those who want to improve their writing, this guide is helpful and will get you hooked.</p>

<p><em>Feedback</em></p>

<p>Feedbacks are critical for personal improvements. For a leader, it is important that they provide rich feedback to their people, and also seek feedback to improve their functionining. This blog by the co-founder of OpenAI was a breath of fresh air. It provides a good survey of techniques to provide feedback that can be helpful for the feedback receiver. A key aspect is to consider the mindset of the feedback giver - if its about learning and not judging, then the feedback becomes a precious gift.
