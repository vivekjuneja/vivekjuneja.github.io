<p>The podcast is an attempt to go behind a profession to learn the life stories that made a person to pick, practice and thrive in it. In each episode, I will speak to people with different jobs and professions, and help understand the pecularities of the work they do. I hope this podcast will help build empathy for each profession by providing a peek into what it takes to thrive in it, and thus inspire listeners to take their journey if the profession excites them.</p>

<p>I am so thrilled to talk to a new person every other week and provide to my audience stories that will not just educate, but motivate to them to explore new opportunities.</p>
