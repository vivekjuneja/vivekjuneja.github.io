<Introduction />
Giving and receiving feedback is the central foundation for my role as an Engineering Manager. This is the time of year when ......

### Know the expectation
Start with asking them what is their expectation from this meeting. This is quite obvious, but it is important for you to calibrate this at the start of the meeting. 

### Set the context
I am leaning on this model of emphasizing on strengths rather than "fixing" weaknesses. I ran into this model couple of years back, and found it be empowering. I tend to explain this model before we get into the specifics of the feedback. I ask them to consider the following things :
- Reflect the feedback about their strengths and development areas, and see how much of it resonates with them. Do they see these strengths and development areas from their vantage point ?
- Reflect moments where their perceived strengths were infact represented as development areas from the feedback. This happens when the person overuses their strength. Finding these moments are critical to self introspection and personal growth.
- Being mindful if the development areas perceived by others are coming in the way for the person to exercise their strengths. Are these development areas slowing down the person ? It is not needed to "fix" these development areas, but being mindful of the moments when these development areas surface up. 

I often get to hear from people ambitious and ready to attack the development areas like a checklist of things to do. I ask them to slow down, and spend time on the reflection. 

### Share the feedback - written works for me
I prefer to compile a feedback memo that summarizes my assessment and the ones from their peers. The memo is then shared as a written document to the person, and ask them to go over that in peace for few minutes.
Once the person has read through the document, I ask them for first impressions. It is important to let the person highlight their emotions after reading the document. Questions to ponder upon :
- What was their main takeaway ?
- Was there something that stood out for them ?
- Is there a feedback that they would like to go into specifics ?
