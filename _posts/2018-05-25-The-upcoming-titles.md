 I am working on some deep topics to write upon for sometime. These topics have been affecting me and my domain of work, and I see a consistent tone of confusion and unclarity that clouds the decision making around them. In the next 3 weeks, I woud like to publish these posts, and through that formally attempt to provide more clarity on the topic. 

#### What Kubernetes teaches us about the future of software development and engineering organizations ?

Kubernetes and the rise of container platforms have changed the way developers think, develop and maintain software services. This would also have effect on how engineering teams need to think about software development, and organizations to plan for infrastructure. Embracing the changes will better support teams adopting Kubernetes and provide them with a new perspective in thinking about cloud native services. In this, we will look at the history of container platforms, and how developer experience has evolved over time. We will also look at how teams leveraging container platforms like Kubernetes would work in a fast and agile organization. 

#### Making machines to learn will become a key skill for every engineer. How do engineers adopt to this key trend and much needed skill.

More than a trend, the rise of cheap compute infrastructure, and access to lot of data has made developers tend to rethink about building new features for software services. We now can attempt to think software development in a completely new way, where applications are not just designed to meet functiona goals, but as a continuous source of data. For a developer who has grown up building monolithic apps, using virtual machine platforms like .NET and Java, and then moving on to container and cloud bandwagon, this new realm of intelligent services that learn from past behavior and self evolving systems is a new paradigm. We will look into what has changed so far, and provide some clear ways for developers to tap into this skill not just by gobbling ML frameworks and shiny new Cloud service, but through structured problem solving steps that advocate making applications that generate lot of data, and can excuse hard coded business logic over self learning by making sense of available data. 

#### Evolution of a Developer building for Cloud

I have been building for cloud platforms since 2008. This is my 9th year, and I am going to take you through a journey on what has changed so far, and tapping on new ideas and practices that have made the life of cloud developer more exciting. 


I am deeply excited. Stay tuned !
