<p><strong>What was great on web</strong></p>

<p>One of the most significant aspects of my job as a leader is to communicate. It permeates every aspect of my role. I love the written word and being good at writing is a constant pursuit for me. Someone recommended me the book ‚ÄúOn Writing well‚Äù by William Zinsser, and it was an amazing book. More recently, I happened to find this online guide, and was delightfully surprised by it. For those who want to improve their writing, this guide is helpful and will get you hooked.</p>

<p>Feedbacks are critical for personal improvements. For a leader, it is important that they provide rich feedback to their people, and also seek feedback to improve their functionining. This blog by the co-founder of OpenAI was a breath of fresh air. It provides a good survey of techniques to provide feedback that can be helpful for the feedback receiver. A key aspect is to consider the mindset of the feedback giver - if its about learning and not judging, then the feedback becomes a precious gift.</p>

This book is a page turner. Reading about Ebola outbreak is like looking into the eye of pure evil. The book goes into the detail about the people on the ground who were eyewitness to the carnage. The book is also a lesson about the human mistakes that caused lives of people, and brought it to the brink of extinction. In the light of the current crisis, it is important that our leaders trust the scientists and not take our guards down when the cases drop. A long term investment in research and development will help us lead the war against the invisible enemy.</p>
